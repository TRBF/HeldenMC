# This is a fullstack application that I made with Django at some point
I don't think this is usable in any way, shape or form. It might be, who knows, I made it for some Minecraft server at some point and that Minecraft Server successfully died (IIRC), therefore this is practically useless. This was also written quite some time ago so I have little doubt that it's thoroughly badly written. And as if that wasn't enough, it was written in P I T O N, which is slow, but it's easy so I guess that's why I picked it

## Framework: Django
## Languages used: Python, HTML & CSS (yes I know they're not quite programming languages)
